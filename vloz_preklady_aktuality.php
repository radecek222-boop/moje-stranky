## LUXURY FURNITURE CARE

![Article photo](/uploads/aktuality/aktualita_9_clanek_2_1763830760.webp)

**Winter and summer care for leather and fabric sofas – how seasons affect your furniture**

Seating sets are not just a place of rest – they are also a distinctive interior element that faces various challenges throughout the year. Changes in temperature, humidity and sunlight intensity have a direct impact on the condition of leather and textile covers. While leather suffers from dry air in winter, it is threatened by strong UV radiation in summer. Fabric covers, in turn, deal with everyday household use and need regular care. Whether it's luxury leather or comfortable textile, proper maintenance is the key to longevity.

---

**Winter months: stress test for leather furniture**
Winter brings pleasant warmth to homes, but also an extreme drop in humidity. Leather on sofas reacts to dry air similarly to human skin – it dries out, loses elasticity and fine cracks may appear. It is during this period that treatment is most important. Regular use of **Natuzzi Leather Care** balm helps hydrate and protect the leather. It is also worth monitoring furniture placement – excessive proximity to a radiator or fireplace can unnecessarily damage the leather quickly.

---

**Summer and its pitfalls: UV radiation as the main enemy**
In summer months, on the other hand, another risk comes – the sun. Intense UV radiation can quickly fade, dry out and harden leather. Direct sunlight through a window is as dangerous for sofas as prolonged sunbathing without protection. If it's not possible to relocate the furniture, blinds, curtains or UV film can help. The leather also benefits from using products with UV protection from the **Natuzzi Leather Care** range, which prevent rapid material aging.

---

**Year-round textile care: comfort that deserves attention**
Textile covers are popular for their softness and breathability. However, everyday life shows most quickly on them – dust, crumbs, stains and friction. Regular vacuuming keeps the fabric fresh and prevents unwanted pilling. Stains are always better dealt with immediately using certified **Natuzzi** cleaners that don't stress the fabric. Occasional rotation of seat cushions is recommended to evenly distribute wear.

---

**When does furniture call for help?**
For both leather and fabric covers, there are several warning signs that it's time for treatment. Leather may start to dull, feel less elastic or too tight to the touch. For textiles, fading or pilling often reveals that the material is taking a beating. Seats losing their shape are also a clear sign that professional care is appropriate.

---

**White Glove Service: professional intervention that extends lifespan**
Anyone who wants to be sure their seating set remains in perfect condition even after years can use the certified **White Glove Service**. This includes deep cleaning, renovation and professional treatment according to material type. Only original products recommended by the manufacturer are used, guaranteeing maximum gentleness and effectiveness.

---

The right combination of professional care and quality **Natuzzi Care** products is the best investment in the long life of your sofa. Whether it's winter, summer or everyday use, a little attention always pays back many times over in the appearance and comfort of your home.

## ITALIAN MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY

**Winter care for leather sofas – complete guide**

The winter period places increased demands on leather furniture. Low air humidity caused by heating can lead to leather drying out. We recommend regular treatment with special Natuzzi Leather Care balms every 2-3 months. Use a humidifier to maintain optimal humidity of 40-60%. Avoid direct contact with radiators and other heat sources.

**Cleaning textile covers – tips from professionals**

For textile covers, we recommend regular vacuuming with a soft attachment at least once a week. For stains, use only certified cleaning products suitable for the specific type of fabric. Natuzzi also offers professional cleaning as part of White Glove Service.

**Premium Italian leather – the pinnacle of quality**

Natuzzi uses only the highest quality natural leather from Italian tanneries. Each leather goes through a 21-day processing process, including special dyeing and surface treatment. The result is a material of exceptional softness, elasticity and high durability.

**Innovative filling materials**

Natuzzi seats use advanced polyurethane foams with varying densities for optimal body support. Memory Foam technology perfectly adapts to body shape and ensures long-term comfort. All materials used meet strict European standards.

**Precise Italian craftsmanship**

Each sofa is hand-assembled by experienced craftsmen in Italy. The solid beech wood construction is reinforced with steel elements for maximum stability. With proper care, Natuzzi furniture achieves an average lifespan of 25+ years.

## CURA DEI MOBILI DI LUSSO

![Foto articolo](/uploads/aktuality/aktualita_9_clanek_2_1763830760.webp)

**Cura invernale ed estiva per divani in pelle e tessuto – come le stagioni influenzano i vostri mobili**

I set di sedute non sono solo un luogo di riposo – sono anche un elemento distintivo dell'interno che affronta varie sfide durante l'anno. I cambiamenti di temperatura, umidità e intensità della luce solare hanno un impatto diretto sulle condizioni dei rivestimenti in pelle e tessuto. Mentre la pelle soffre per l'aria secca in inverno, in estate è minacciata dalle forti radiazioni UV. I rivestimenti in tessuto, a loro volta, affrontano l'uso quotidiano domestico e necessitano di cure regolari. Che si tratti di pelle di lusso o tessuto confortevole, la manutenzione corretta è la chiave per la longevità.

---

**Mesi invernali: prova di resistenza per i mobili in pelle**
L'inverno porta calore piacevole nelle case, ma anche un calo estremo dell'umidità. La pelle sui divani reagisce all'aria secca in modo simile alla pelle umana – si secca, perde elasticità e possono apparire sottili crepe. È proprio in questo periodo che il trattamento è più importante. L'uso regolare del balsamo **Natuzzi Leather Care** aiuta a idratare e proteggere la pelle. Vale anche la pena monitorare il posizionamento dei mobili – l'eccessiva vicinanza a un termosifone o camino può danneggiare rapidamente la pelle.

---

**Estate e le sue insidie: le radiazioni UV come nemico principale**
Nei mesi estivi, invece, arriva un altro rischio – il sole. Le intense radiazioni UV possono rapidamente sbiadire, seccare e indurire la pelle. La luce solare diretta attraverso una finestra è pericolosa per i divani quanto l'esposizione prolungata al sole senza protezione. Se non è possibile spostare i mobili, possono aiutare tende, persiane o pellicole UV. La pelle beneficia anche dell'uso di prodotti con protezione UV della gamma **Natuzzi Leather Care**, che prevengono il rapido invecchiamento del materiale.

---

**Cura del tessuto tutto l'anno: comfort che merita attenzione**
I rivestimenti in tessuto sono apprezzati per la loro morbidezza e traspirabilità. Tuttavia, la vita quotidiana si manifesta più rapidamente su di essi – polvere, briciole, macchie e attrito. L'aspirazione regolare mantiene il tessuto fresco e previene l'indesiderato pilling. Le macchie è sempre meglio trattarle immediatamente usando detergenti certificati **Natuzzi** che non stressano il tessuto. Si raccomanda la rotazione occasionale dei cuscini delle sedute per distribuire uniformemente l'usura.

---

**Quando i mobili chiedono aiuto?**
Sia per i rivestimenti in pelle che in tessuto, ci sono diversi segnali di avvertimento che è tempo di trattamento. La pelle può iniziare a opacizzarsi, risultare meno elastica o troppo tesa al tatto. Per i tessuti, lo sbiadimento o il pilling spesso rivelano che il materiale sta subendo stress. I sedili che perdono la forma sono anche un chiaro segno che è appropriata una cura professionale.

---

**White Glove Service: intervento professionale che prolunga la vita**
Chiunque voglia essere sicuro che il proprio set di sedute rimanga in perfette condizioni anche dopo anni può utilizzare il certificato **White Glove Service**. Questo include pulizia profonda, rinnovamento e trattamento professionale secondo il tipo di materiale. Vengono utilizzati solo prodotti originali raccomandati dal produttore, garantendo massima delicatezza ed efficacia.

---

La giusta combinazione di cura professionale e prodotti di qualità **Natuzzi Care** è il miglior investimento nella lunga vita del vostro divano. Che sia inverno, estate o uso quotidiano, una piccola attenzione ripaga sempre molte volte in aspetto e comfort della vostra casa.

## MATERIALI E TECNOLOGIA ITALIANA

**Cura invernale per divani in pelle – guida completa**

Il periodo invernale pone maggiori esigenze sui mobili in pelle. La bassa umidità dell'aria causata dal riscaldamento può portare all'essiccamento della pelle. Raccomandiamo un trattamento regolare con speciali balsami Natuzzi Leather Care ogni 2-3 mesi. Usa un umidificatore per mantenere l'umidità ottimale del 40-60%. Evita il contatto diretto con termosifoni e altre fonti di calore.

**Pulizia dei rivestimenti in tessuto – consigli dai professionisti**

Per i rivestimenti in tessuto, raccomandiamo l'aspirazione regolare con un accessorio morbido almeno una volta alla settimana. Per le macchie, usa solo prodotti detergenti certificati adatti al tipo specifico di tessuto. Natuzzi offre anche la pulizia professionale come parte del White Glove Service.

**Pelle italiana premium – l'apice della qualità**

Natuzzi utilizza solo pelle naturale della più alta qualità dalle concerie italiane. Ogni pelle passa attraverso un processo di lavorazione di 21 giorni, inclusa la tintura speciale e il trattamento superficiale. Il risultato è un materiale di eccezionale morbidezza, elasticità e alta durabilità.

**Materiali di imbottitura innovativi**

I sedili Natuzzi utilizzano schiume poliuretaniche avanzate con densità variabili per un supporto ottimale del corpo. La tecnologia Memory Foam si adatta perfettamente alla forma del corpo e garantisce comfort a lungo termine. Tutti i materiali utilizzati soddisfano rigorosi standard europei.

**Artigianato italiano preciso**

Ogni divano è assemblato a mano da artigiani esperti in Italia. La struttura in legno massello di faggio è rinforzata con elementi in acciaio per la massima stabilità. Con la cura adeguata, i mobili Natuzzi raggiungono una durata media di 25+ anni.
